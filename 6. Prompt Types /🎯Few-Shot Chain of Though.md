## üéØ Few-Shot Chain of Thought (Few-Shot-CoT)

Few-Shot Chain of Thought (Few-Shot-CoT) is an advanced prompting technique that provides a small number of examples (typically 1-5) demonstrating step-by-step reasoning before asking the model to solve a new problem. This approach guides the model's thought process and improves its performance on complex tasks by leveraging example-based learning.

### Use Cases

<details>
<summary>Click to expand use cases</summary>

1. **Training on specific problem-solving methodologies:** Helps in teaching consistent approaches to problem-solving
2. **Standardizing analysis approaches across a team:** Ensures all team members follow the same logical steps
3. **Tackling complex, multi-step problems with established procedures:** Useful for problems with known solution patterns

### Example Structure

When using Few-Shot-CoT, structure your prompt like this:

```markdown
Task: [Describe the task]

Prompt:
"Here are two examples of solving [type of problem]:

Example 1:
Q: [First example question]
A: Let's solve this step by step:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]
[Conclusion]

Example 2:
Q: [Second example question]
A: Let's break it down:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]
[Conclusion]

Now, solve this new problem using the same approach:
Q: [New problem to solve]"
```

<summary>Home Appliance Troubleshooting</summary>

```markdown
**Prompt:** Let's use Few-Shot Chain of Thought to teach a beginner how to troubleshoot common household appliance issues:

1. Refrigerator not cooling:
   - Step 1: Check if the fridge is plugged in and the circuit breaker hasn't tripped.
   - Step 2: Ensure the temperature control is set correctly.
   - Step 3: Clean the condenser coils at the back or bottom of the fridge.
   Example: In a recent case, cleaning the coils resolved the cooling issue for a 5-year-old refrigerator.

2. Washing machine not draining:
   - Step 1: Check for clogs in the drain hose.
   - Step 2: Clean the pump filter located at the front bottom of the machine.
   - Step 3: Ensure the drain hose isn't kinked or bent.
   Example: Last month, a homeowner found coins blocking the pump filter, causing drainage issues.

3. Microwave not heating:
   - Step 1: Test if the outlet is working by plugging in another appliance.
   - Step 2: Check if the door is closing properly and the safety latch is engaging.
   - Step 3: Listen for the fan and turntable motor when the microwave is on.
   Example: Recently, a faulty door switch prevented a microwave from starting, which was fixed by replacing the switch.

Now, apply this troubleshooting process to diagnose and potentially fix an issue with your dishwasher that's not cleaning dishes properly.

<summary>Educational Strategies</summary>

```markdown
**Prompt:** Let's use Few-Shot Chain of Thought to demonstrate effective teaching strategies for different learning styles:

1. Visual Learners:
   Example 1: Teaching the water cycle
   - Step 1: Create a colorful diagram showing the stages of the water cycle.
   - Step 2: Use animated videos to demonstrate evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.
   - Step 3: Have students create their own illustrated water cycle posters.

2. Auditory Learners:
   Example 2: Teaching multiplication tables
   - Step 1: Create rhythmic chants for each multiplication table (e.g., "2, 4, 6, 8, who do we appreciate? 2 times tables!").
   - Step 2: Use musical mnemonics to help memorize harder facts.
   - Step 3: Encourage students to explain multiplication concepts to each other verbally.

3. Kinesthetic Learners:
   Example 3: Teaching basic geometry
   - Step 1: Use tangible shapes for students to manipulate and explore.
   - Step 2: Create a geometry scavenger hunt around the classroom or school.
   - Step 3: Have students use their bodies to form different shapes and angles.

Now, apply these strategies to develop a lesson plan for teaching the concept of photosynthesis, incorporating elements for each learning style.
