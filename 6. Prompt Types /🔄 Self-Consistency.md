## üîÑ Self-Consistency

Self-Consistency is an advanced prompting technique designed to improve the reliability and accuracy of language model outputs. It works by generating multiple independent solutions to a problem and then selecting the most consistent or frequently occurring answer. This method helps to mitigate the impact of random errors or biases that might occur in a single generation, leading to more robust and trustworthy results.

### Use Cases

<details>
<summary>Click to expand use cases</summary>

1. **Fact-checking and verification:** Helps in confirming information by cross-referencing multiple generated answers
2. **Enhancing reliability in critical decision-making:** Provides a more robust basis for important choices by considering multiple perspectives
3. **Resolving ambiguities in complex problems:** Allows for clearer solutions by identifying consistent patterns across multiple attempts

### Example Structure

```markdown
When using Self-Consistency, structure your prompt to generate and compare multiple solutions:

Task: "Solve a complex problem"
Prompt: "Generate three independent solutions to this problem: [State the problem]"
Output:
"Solution 1: [First approach]
Solution 2: [Second approach]
Solution 3: [Third approach]
Consistent Answer: [Most common or consistent result]"
```

### Examples of Self-Consistency Prompts

<details>
<summary>Example 1: Math Word Problem</summary>

```markdown
Task: "Solve a complex math word problem"
Prompt: "Generate three independent solutions to this problem: A store is having a 30% off sale. If you buy a shirt originally priced at $50 and a pair of jeans originally priced at $80, how much will you save in total?"

Output:
"Solution 1:
Calculate 30% of $50: 0.30 √ó $50 = $15 (savings on shirt)
Calculate 30% of $80: 0.30 √ó $80 = $24 (savings on jeans)
Total savings: $15 + $24 = $39

Solution 2:
Total original price: $50 + $80 = $130
Calculate 30% of $130: 0.30 √ó $130 = $39
Total savings: $39

Solution 3:
Shirt savings: 30% of $50 = $50 √ó 0.30 = $15
Jeans savings: 30% of $80 = $80 √ó 0.30 = $24
Add savings: $15 + $24 = $39

Consistent Answer: All three solutions arrive at the same result. You will save $39 in total."

<summary>Example 2: Urban Planning</summary>

```markdown
Apply the Self-Consistency method to develop a sustainable urban transportation plan for a rapidly growing city. Follow these steps:

1. Generate five independent transportation plans, each focusing on different priorities (e.g., public transit, cycling infrastructure, electric vehicles, pedestrian-friendly design, smart traffic management).
2. For each plan, provide detailed proposals, estimated costs, and projected impact on traffic congestion and air quality.
3. Compare the five plans, identifying common elements and major differences.
4. For each significant difference, explain the underlying assumptions and local factors influencing the approach.
5. Synthesize the most consistent and effective elements from all plans to create a comprehensive, multi-modal transportation strategy.
6. Assign a feasibility score (1-10) to each component of the final strategy, based on its prevalence across plans and alignment with the city's budget and long-term goals.

<summary>Example 3: Educational Curriculum Design</summary>

```markdown
Utilize the Self-Consistency method to design an innovative high school curriculum that prepares students for the challenges of the 21st century. Proceed as follows:

1. Create five independent curriculum models, each emphasizing different educational philosophies (e.g., STEM focus, liberal arts, project-based learning, vocational training, global citizenship).
2. For each model, outline core subjects, teaching methodologies, and assessment strategies.
3. Analyze the five models, identifying common threads and notable divergences.
4. For each significant divergence, explain the educational theory or real-world demand driving that approach.
5. Combine the most consistent and forward-thinking elements from all models to form a balanced, comprehensive curriculum.
6. Assign an effectiveness rating (1-10) to each component of the final curriculum, based on its frequency across models and its potential to develop critical skills for future success.

<summary>Example 4: Environmental Conservation Strategy</summary>

```markdown
Employ the Self-Consistency method to develop a comprehensive strategy for protecting and restoring a threatened ecosystem. Follow this process:

1. Generate five independent conservation plans, each prioritizing different aspects (e.g., habitat restoration, species protection, community involvement, sustainable resource use, climate change adaptation).
2. For each plan, provide detailed action items, resource requirements, and expected outcomes over a 10-year period.
3. Compare the five plans, identifying common approaches and major differences.
4. For each significant difference, explain the ecological or socio-economic factors influencing that strategy.
5. Synthesize the most consistent and impactful elements from all plans to create a holistic ecosystem management approach.
6. Assign a viability score (1-10) to each component of the final strategy, based on its prevalence across plans and its potential for long-term positive impact on the ecosystem.

<summary>Example 5: Meal Planning</summary>

```markdown
Implement the Self-Consistency method to create a comprehensive and balanced weekly meal plan. Follow these steps:

1. Generate five independent weekly meal plans, each focusing on different nutritional priorities or dietary approaches:
   - Plan A: High-protein, low-carb
   - Plan B: Plant-based and rich in whole foods
   - Plan C: Mediterranean diet-inspired
   - Plan D: Balanced macronutrients with emphasis on portion control
   - Plan E: Culturally diverse cuisines with a focus on anti-inflammatory foods

2. For each plan, provide:
   - A full 7-day menu including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks
   - Estimated macronutrient breakdown for each day
   - A shopping list of required ingredients
   - Preparation time estimates for each meal

3. Analyze the five meal plans, identifying:
   - Common ingredients or food groups across all plans
   - Similarities in meal structures or eating patterns
   - Notable differences in approach or specific food choices

4. For each significant difference, explain the nutritional reasoning or dietary philosophy behind the choice.

5. Synthesize the most consistent and beneficial elements from all plans to create a final, well-rounded weekly meal plan that:
   - Incorporates a variety of nutrients
   - Balances health goals with taste preferences
   - Includes a mix of quick meals and more elaborate dishes
   - Allows for some flexibility and substitutions

6. Assign a sustainability score (1-10) to each meal in the final plan, based on:
   - Its frequency across the individual plans
   - Ease of preparation
   - Cost-effectiveness
   - Alignment with long-term health goals

7. Provide a brief rationale for the final meal plan, explaining how it addresses various nutritional needs while remaining practical and enjoyable for everyday use.

## üí° Pro Tips for Effective Self-Consistency Prompts

1. **Generate diverse solutions:** Encourage the model to approach the problem from different angles to ensure a wide range of potential solutions.
2. **Use an appropriate number of iterations:** Typically, 3-5 solutions provide a good balance between diversity and efficiency.
3. **Clearly define the problem:** Ensure the initial prompt is unambiguous to avoid inconsistent interpretations.
4. **Consider edge cases:** Include prompts for potential edge cases or unusual scenarios to test the robustness of the solutions.
5. **Analyze discrepancies:** When solutions differ, investigate the reasons for these differences to gain deeper insights.
