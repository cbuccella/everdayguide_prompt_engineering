## üß† Chain of Thought (CoT)

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that encourages language models to break down complex problems into explicit intermediate steps, showing their reasoning process step-by-step. This approach often leads to more accurate and transparent results.

### Use Cases

1. **Mathematical problem-solving:** Helps in showing each calculation step
2. **Logical reasoning tasks:** Useful for deductive or inductive reasoning processes
3. **Multi-step analysis:** Breaks down complex scenarios into manageable parts in business or scientific contexts
4. **Novel problem-solving scenarios:** Applies structured thinking to unfamiliar situations
5. **Quick analysis:** Provides a framework for rapid assessment of new information
6. **Generalizing reasoning skills:** Helps in applying logical thinking across various domains

### Examples

<summary>Mathematical Problem</summary>

**Problem:** "Determine the total cost of a meal for four people at a restaurant, including a 15% tip and 8% sales tax."

Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let's assume the base cost of the meal is $100.
2. Calculate the sales tax: 8% of $100 = $8
3. Add the sales tax to the base cost: $100 + $8 = $108
4. Calculate the tip: 15% of the original $100 = $15
5. Add the tip to the total: $108 + $15 = $123

Therefore, the total cost of the meal for four people, including tax and tip, is $123.

<summary>Novel Problem-Solving Scenario</summary>

**Problem:** "How might climate change affect migration patterns of arctic animals?"

Let's think through this logically:
1. Initial consideration: Climate change is causing the Arctic to warm faster than other regions.
2. This warming leads to melting sea ice and changing vegetation patterns.
3. Many arctic animals depend on sea ice for hunting, breeding, and resting.
4. As sea ice diminishes, these animals may need to travel farther to find suitable habitats.
5. Changes in vegetation could affect herbivorous species, altering their distribution.
6. Predators would likely follow the movements of their prey.
7. Some species might adapt to the new conditions, while others may struggle.

Conclusion: Climate change is likely to cause significant shifts in arctic animal migration patterns, with species moving northward or to higher elevations in search of suitable habitats and food sources. This could lead to changes in ecosystem dynamics and potentially threaten species that cannot adapt quickly enough.

### üí° Pro Tips for Effective CoT Prompts

1. **Be explicit:** Clearly instruct the AI to show its work or explain its reasoning.
2. **Break it down:** For complex problems, suggest dividing the task into smaller steps.
3. **Encourage exploration:** Ask the AI to consider multiple angles or potential outcomes.
4. **Request verification:** Prompt the AI to check its logic or calculations at key steps.
5. **Seek elaboration:** If a step seems unclear, ask for more detailed explanation.
