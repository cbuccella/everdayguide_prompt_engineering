### Example Structure

```markdown
Task: Generate an engaging writing prompt for a short story

APE Process:
1. Generate Prompts:
   - "Write a story about a mysterious object found in an attic"
   - "Describe a character's first day in a new, unusual job"
   - "Narrate an unexpected encounter between two strangers on a train"

2. Evaluate Prompts:
   Criteria: Creativity, potential for character development, plot intrigue
   Scores: [Hypothetical scores for each prompt]

3. Optimize:
   Refined prompt: "Write a story about two strangers who discover a mysterious object in an attic during their first day at an unusual job"
```

<summary>Example 1: Developing Optimal Interview Questions</summary>

```markdown
Use APE to create an effective set of interview questions for hiring software engineers:

1. Initial generation:
   - Utilize the question categories: Technical Depth, Problem Solving, and Cultural Fit
   - Generate multiple sets of questions, each containing one question per category

2. Evaluation:
   Assess each question set based on:
   - Technical depth (e.g., OOP concepts, design patterns)
   - Problem-solving approach (e.g., algorithmic thinking, creative solutions)
   - Cultural fit alignment (e.g., teamwork, communication skills)

3. Refinement:
   - Analyze high-performing questions and identify common characteristics
   - Generate new questions that incorporate these successful elements

4. Testing:
   - Conduct mock interviews using the refined question sets
   - Gather feedback from both interviewers and interviewees

5. Iteration:
   - Use machine learning algorithms to analyze interview outcomes
   - Continuously update the question pool based on performance metrics
   - Periodically introduce new questions to maintain relevance and prevent overfitting

<summary>üìù Practice Exercise: Designing an APE System</summary>

1. Choose a specific task or domain for which you want to generate optimized prompts (e.g., language learning exercises, customer service chatbot responses, or product description generation).

2. Define the goals of your APE system and list 3-5 key criteria for evaluating prompt effectiveness in your chosen domain.

3. Outline the main components of your APE system:
   a. Prompt generation module: Describe how it will create initial prompts
   b. Evaluation module: Explain how it will assess prompt quality based on your criteria
   c. Refinement module: Describe how it will improve prompts based on evaluation results
   d. Testing and feedback module: Explain how you'll gather and incorporate real-world performance data

4. Create a sample set of 5-10 initial prompts that your system might generate for your chosen task.

5. Develop a simple scoring system for your evaluation criteria and demonstrate how you would score your sample prompts.

6. Describe the refinement process: How would your system improve low-scoring prompts or combine elements of high-scoring ones?

7. Outline a plan for testing refined prompts and collecting user feedback.
