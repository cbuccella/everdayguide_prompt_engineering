## ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic Reasoning and Tool-Use (ART)

Automatic Reasoning and Tool-Use (ART) is an advanced prompting method that combines reasoning with automated tool selection and use. This technique enables language models to autonomously reason about problems and select/use appropriate tools to solve them. It enhances the model's problem-solving capabilities by integrating external tools and resources into its reasoning process.

### Use Cases

### Example Structure

```markdown
Determine the best day for an outdoor event next month

Process:
1. Thought: We need to check weather forecasts and local event calendars.
2. Tool Selection: Weather forecasting API and local events database
3. Tool Use: Query weather API for next month's forecast; search events database for conflicting dates
4. Integration: Analyze weather data and event conflicts
5. Next Step: Based on the analysis, recommend the optimal date for the outdoor event
