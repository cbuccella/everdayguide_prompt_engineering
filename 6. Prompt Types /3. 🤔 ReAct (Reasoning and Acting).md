## ü§î ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is an advanced prompting technique that combines reasoning with action-taking. It allows the model to interact with its environment or external tools while solving a problem, enabling a more dynamic and adaptive problem-solving process. This approach mimics human problem-solving by alternating between thinking and acting.
