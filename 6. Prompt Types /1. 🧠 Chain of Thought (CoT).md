## üß† Chain of Thought (CoT)

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique that encourages language models to break down complex problems into explicit intermediate steps, showing their reasoning process step-by-step. This approach often leads to more accurate and transparent results.

### Use Cases

### üí° Pro Tip: Adapting CoT to Different Domains

As you can see from these examples, Chain of Thought prompting can be applied to a wide range of domains and problem types. When crafting your own CoT prompts:

1. **Identify key steps:** Break down the problem into logical, sequential steps.
2. **Ask guiding questions:** For each step, formulate a question that prompts deeper thinking.
3. **Encourage explanation:** Always ask for detailed reasoning or calculations.
4. **Consider domain-specific factors:** Tailor your steps to the unique aspects of the field or problem type.
5. **Balance structure and flexibility:** Provide enough structure to guide the thought process, but allow room for creative problem-solving.
