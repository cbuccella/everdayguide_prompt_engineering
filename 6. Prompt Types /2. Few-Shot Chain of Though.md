## üéØ Few-Shot Chain of Thought (Few-Shot-CoT)

Few-Shot Chain of Thought (Few-Shot-CoT) is an advanced prompting technique that provides a small number of examples (typically 1-5) demonstrating step-by-step reasoning before asking the model to solve a new problem. This approach guides the model's thought process and improves its performance on complex tasks by leveraging example-based learning.

### Use Cases

<details>
<summary>Click to expand use cases</summary>

1. **Training on specific problem-solving methodologies:** Helps in teaching consistent approaches to problem-solving
2. **Standardizing analysis approaches across a team:** Ensures all team members follow the same logical steps
3. **Tackling complex, multi-step problems with established procedures:** Useful for problems with known solution patterns

### Example Structure

When using Few-Shot-CoT, structure your prompt like this:

```markdown
Task: [Describe the task]

Prompt:
"Here are two examples of solving [type of problem]:

Example 1:
Q: [First example question]
A: Let's solve this step by step:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]
[Conclusion]

Example 2:
Q: [Second example question]
A: Let's break it down:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]
[Conclusion]

Now, solve this new problem using the same approach:
Q: [New problem to solve]"
```

### Detailed Example: Percentage Problems

<details>

Task: "Solve word problems involving percentages"

Prompt:
"Here are two examples of solving percentage problems:

Example 1:
Q: If a shirt originally priced at $80 is on sale for 25% off, what is the sale price?
A: Let's solve this step by step:
1. Calculate the discount amount: 25% of $80 = 0.25 √ó $80 = $20
2. Subtract the discount from the original price: $80 - $20 = $60
3. The sale price is $60.

Example 2:
Q: A restaurant bill is $45, and you want to leave a 15% tip. How much should you tip?
A: Let's break it down:
1. Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15
2. Calculate the tip: $45 √ó 0.15 = $6.75
3. The tip should be $6.75.

Now, solve this new problem using the same approach:
Q: A car is listed for $12,000, but the dealer offers a 10% discount. What is the final price after the discount?"

Output:
"Let's solve this step by step:
1. Calculate the discount amount: 10% of $12,000 = 0.10 √ó $12,000 = $1,200
2. Subtract the discount from the original price: $12,000 - $1,200 = $10,800
3. The final price after the discount is $10,800."

### üí° Pro Tips for Effective Few-Shot-CoT Prompts

1. **Choose relevant examples:** Select examples that closely match the structure and complexity of the target problem.
2. **Maintain consistency:** Use a similar format and level of detail across all examples.
3. **Highlight key steps:** Ensure that crucial problem-solving steps are clearly demonstrated in the examples.
4. **Vary slightly:** Include minor variations in the examples to demonstrate flexibility in the approach.
5. **Limit the number:** Generally, 2-3 examples are sufficient; too many can overwhelm the model.
