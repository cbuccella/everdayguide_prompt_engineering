# 🧩 Anatomy of a Prompt: Building Blocks for Success

Understanding the key components of a prompt is crucial for effective prompt engineering. Let's break down the essential parts:

<details>
<summary>1. 🎯 The Directive</summary>

The core instruction or question in your prompt.

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Example: "Summarize the main points of this article."
</code></pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. 📚 Examples</summary>

Demonstrations of desired inputs and outputs.

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Example: "Input: 'Hello', Output: 'Bonjour'" (for a translation task)
</code></pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. 🎭 Role</summary>

A specific persona assigned to the AI.

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Example: "You are an experienced chef specializing in Italian cuisine."
</code></pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. 📋 Output Formatting</summary>

Instructions for how the response should be structured.

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Example: "Present your answer in a numbered list."
</code></pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. 🌟 Style Instructions</summary>

Guidance on the tone or style of the response.

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Example: "Write in a friendly, conversational tone."
</code></pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. 📝 Additional Information</summary>

Extra context or data to inform the AI's response.

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Example: "The target audience is middle school students."
</code></pre>
</details>

## 🔑 Pro Tip

While not every prompt needs all these elements, including them can significantly enhance the quality and relevance of AI responses.

💡 Remember: Placing the directive near the end of your prompt helps ensure the AI focuses on executing your instruction rather than generating more context.

## 🛠️ Practical Application

Try building a prompt using these building blocks in your Local LLM like ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude.
