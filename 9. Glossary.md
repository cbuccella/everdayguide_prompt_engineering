| 🎯 Prompt | A specific input or instruction given to an AI model to elicit a desired output or behavior. |
| 🧠 Language Model (LM) | An AI system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. |
| 🔗 Chain of Thought (CoT) | A prompting technique that encourages step-by-step reasoning in AI responses. |
| 🚀 Zero-Shot | The ability of an AI model to perform tasks without specific training examples. |
| 🎯 Few-Shot | A technique where a small number of examples are provided to guide the AI's response. |
| 🤔 ReAct | A prompting method combining reasoning and action-taking for more dynamic problem-solving. |
